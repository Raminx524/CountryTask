        <strong>
          Spain or the Kingdom of Spain is a country primarily located in
          Southwestern Europe, with parts of its territory in the Atlantic Ocean
          and across the Mediterranean Sea. The largest part of Spain is
          situated on the Iberian Peninsula; its territory also includes the
          Canary Islands in the Atlantic Ocean, the Balearic Islands in the
          Mediterranean Sea, and the autonomous cities of Ceuta and Melilla in
          Africa. The country's mainland is bordered to the north by France,
          Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; to the east and south by the
          Mediterranean Sea and Gibraltar; and to the west by Portugal and the
          Atlantic Ocean. It is the largest country in Southern Europe and the
          second-largest and fourth-most populous in the European Union. Spain's
          capital and largest city is Madrid; other major urban areas include
          Barcelona, Valencia, Zaragoza, Seville, MÃ¡laga, Murcia, Palma de
          Mallorca, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, and Bilbao.
